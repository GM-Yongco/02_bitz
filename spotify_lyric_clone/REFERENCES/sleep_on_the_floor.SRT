1
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,050
Pack yourself a toothbrush dear

2
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,750
Pack yourself a favorite blouse

3
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,100
Take a withdrawal slip, take
all of your savings out

4
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,000
Cause if we don't leave this town

5
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,300
We might never make it out

6
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,900
I was not born to drown, baby come on

7
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,250
Forget what Father Brennan said

8
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,900
We were not born in sin

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,550
Leave a note on your bed

10
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,300
Let your mother know you're safe

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,700
And by the time she wakes

12
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,850
We'll have driven through the state

13
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:18,900
We'll have driven through
the night, baby come on

14
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,500
If the sun don't shine on me today

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,800
And if the subways flood
and bridges break

16
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,800
Will you lay yourself down
and dig your grave

17
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,800
Or will you rail against
your dying day

18
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,500
And when we looked outside,
couldn't even see the sky

19
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,000
How do you pay the rent,
is it your parents

20
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,500
Or is it hard work dear

21
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,400
Holding the atmosphere

22
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,500
I don't wanna live like that

23
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,500
If the sun don't shine on me today

24
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:27,400
If the subways flood and
the bridges break

25
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,300
Jesus Christ can't save me tonight

26
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Put on your dress, yes
wear something nice

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Decide on me, yea decide on us

28
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:54,400
Oh, oh, oh, Illinois, Illinois

29
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,950
Pack yourself a toothbrush dear

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,400
Pack yourself a favorite blouse

31
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,400
Take a withdrawal slip, take
all of your savings out

32
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Cause if we don't leave this town

33
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,000
We might never make it out

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
