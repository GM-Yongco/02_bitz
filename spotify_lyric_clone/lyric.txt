Pluto is a boy from LA
Spent most his time in Venice Beach
Pluto is a boy from LA
Spent most his time in Venice Beach
Pluto lived life on ice skates
But always landed on his feet
Pluto looked forward to Sundays
On Sunday, he saw Genevieve
He loved Genevieve
But never said anything to her
He thought she was out of his league
Nothing would hurt more than thinking she'd leave him (thinking she'd leave him)
She'd never leave him (she'd never leave him)
She'd never leavе
Little did he know that she fеlt the same
Wanted to tell him, but she was afraid
Nothing compared to the day that he sang her name
Genevieve, it's okay if you don't love me
Genevieve, either way, you're still all I see
Genevieve, all I want is your company
Genevieve, Genevieve
Pluto wasn't one to complain
Wasn't as happy as he seemed
Kept his chin higher than airplanes
Even though hurricanes were beneath
Pluto looked forward to Sundays
On Sunday, he saw Genevieve (he saw Genevieve)
He loved Genevieve (he loved Genevieve)
But never said anything to her
He thought she was out of his league
Nothing would hurt more than thinking she'd leave him
She'd never leave him
She'd never leave
Little did he know that she felt the same
Wanted to tell him, but she was afraid
Nothing compared to the day that he sang her name
Genevieve, it's okay if you don't love me (if you don't love me)
Genevieve, either way, you're still all I see (all I see)
Genevieve, all I want is your company (I want your company, yeah)
Genevieve, Genevieve (I want your company, yeah)
I can't keep it inside
It's like a miracle when our worlds collide
If this is meant to be, then show me a sign
And if it's not, I'll put my feelings inside (I'll put my feelings inside)
Genevieve, it's okay if you don't love me
Either way, you're still all I see
All I want is your company
Genevieve
Genevieve, it's okay if you don't love me (if you don't love me)
Genevieve, either way, you're still all I see (you're still all I see)
Genevieve, all I want is your company (all I want)
Genevieve, Genevieve
It's okay, it's, it's okay
It is okay, it's, it's, it's okay
